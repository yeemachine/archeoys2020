    "The annual End of Year Show is a decades-old tradition at The Cooper Union, historically a moment when the schools of Architecture, Art, and Engineering mark the end of the academic year by mounting respective exhibitions of student work in the Foundation Building and 41 Cooper Square. Each year, this celebratory act shares the work of the school with alumni and the general public.",
    "This year’s exhibition was born out of a challenge by Dean Nader Tehrani to mount an End of Year Show wherein work produced by the school could inhabit a virtual Foundation Building. At a time where the school’s buildings are physically inaccessible, Architecture faculty, students and staff have collaborated to create this exhibition, allowing visitors to traverse its spaces and explore student work in a digital environment. This exhibition not only celebrates the work of the faculty and students of The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, but also their resilience and ingenuity in developing new ways of operating within a digital landscape."

  title: "About",
  paragraphs: [
    "This exhibition would not have been possible without work completed in two Advanced Concepts architecture courses during the 2019-20 academic year. Taught by Farzin Lotfi-Jam and Greg Schleusner, and supported through an Epic MegaGrant, these courses allowed students to use real-time gaming technologies to visualize and simulate the spatial algorithms that are shaping the future of cities. Although they planned to share their work through Realtime: Input, Display, Response, an exhibition planned for the Houghton Gallery this spring, the project was postponed due to Cooper Union’s closure in mid-March.",

    "Equipped with their knowledge of real-time simulations, students from Lotfi-Jam and Schleusner’s course became the core members of the virtual EOYS production team. They began by digitally constructing Cooper Union’s Foundation Building, which included generating models of the building’s interior and integrating them with existing models of its façade. During this process, the exhibition’s scope expanded to include new spaces within the building not traditionally occupied by the School of Architecture’s End of Year Show. The exhibition also required extensive participation from faculty and students, who collaborated to develop layouts for their respective exhibition spaces while working in a new digital environment.",

    "The production team, as well as students and faculty throughout the school, overcame several logistical challenges to complete this project. Long daily Zoom calls connected participants across U.S. and international time zones—from New York City and Los Angeles to Delhi and Singapore—while the team worked remotely on the School’s computers and software with essential support from Cooper Union’s IT department and facilities staff. And as the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread protests unfolded, team members took time to lend their own voices to this historical moment.",

    "As Dean Tehrani recently noted, “to be finalizing this exhibition at a time when our world is confronting centuries of systemic racism has brought even more weight and meaning to the potential of the extraordinary work of our students. All of our design studios considered a wide range of themes, engaging challenges of natural disaster, social struggle, environmental decadence, and problematic histories, in addition to the larger impact of infrastructures at the geographic scale—complex systems and events which we know negatively affect people of color, underrepresented minorities, those without access to education or health care, and communities suffering from economic inequality.”",

    'The School of Architecture plans to keep the exhibition site up indefinitely, with online public events scheduled between June 17 and July 31. Much of the student work presented in the exhibition will eventually be included in the school’s free, online <a href="https://archswc.cooper.edu/">Student Work Collection</a> database, which represents over eight decades of The Cooper Union’s experimental, influential approach to architectural education.'
